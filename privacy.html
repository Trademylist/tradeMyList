        <h2 class="h3"><b>18. Governing law; arbitration.</b></h2>
        <p>The terms of this agreement are governed by the laws of the united states (including federal arbitration law) and the state of new york, without regard to its principles of conflicts of law, and regardless of your location. Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to this agreement or any aspect of the relationship between you and company, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that company and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Except as provided below regarding the class action waiver, such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge. However, as set forth below, the preceding arbitration requirement shall not apply to disputes to the extent relating to the interpretation or application of the class action waiver below, including its enforceability, revocability or validity.</p>
        <p>You agree that any arbitration under this agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section or any other provision of this agreement or in the american arbitration association’s consumer arbitration rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability or validity of the foregoing class action waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action, and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of such class action waiver is unenforceable, then the class, collective, and/or representative action, to that extent, must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of such class action waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.</p>
        <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American arbitration association under its consumer arbitration rules, as amended by this agreement. The consumer arbitration rules are available online https://www.adr.org/consumer. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the aaa or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.</p>
        <h2 class="h3"><b>19. Information or complaints.</b></h2>
        <p>Export controls.</p>

We may limit the service’s availability at any time, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction that we choose.</p>

        <p>We may change this agreement from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting a revised agreement through the service. Any such changes will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we posted the revised agreement incorporating such changes, or otherwise notified you of such changes.</p>

The “last updated” legend above indicates when this agreement was last changed. We may, at any time and without liability, modify or discontinue all or part of the service; charge, modify or waive any fees required to use the service; or offer opportunities to some or all service users.</p>

        <h2 class="h3"><b>24. Miscellaneous.</b></h2>
