                                <strong>Do your due diligence</strong> - Do your research and homework, read an item's description, ask questions and request for photos to ensure an item you are getting is as you have expected.
                                <p>If you come across an item which you think should not be sold on Trade, do not hesitate to report it to us so that it can be reviewed and removed if needed.</p>

                            <li><strong>Read user reviews</strong> - You can read through detailed reviews that a seller received by going to their profile. This is where other community members, including buyers like yourself, share their experiences dealing with the user.</li>
                            <li><strong>Learn about a seller's policies</strong> - Every deal on Trade is considered an agreement between you and the seller. If any sellers have individual policies, such as whether they accept negotiations, refunds or exchanges, be sure to clue yourself in on them before you commit to a deal.</li>

                                <strong>Secure an agreement by making an offer</strong> - This, along with the seller's acceptance of the offer, is Trade way of a firm handshake to show both parties are committed to the deal. This is because both parties would be able to exchange review thereafter.
                                <p>The right time to make to do this would be when all aspects of the transaction have been negotiated and agreed on, such as price and delivery method, day & time etc. </p>

                            <li><strong>Use the review system</strong> – Leaving reviews for one another is one of the best ways we can help each other; praise Trade that have been good to you, let them know if things can be improved next time. The more we know about our community (and ourselves), the better it is for everyone!</li>
                            <li><strong>Opt for meet-ups so you can check your item</strong> - A perk of opting for meet-ups is so that you would be able to check and ensure that it is as you have expected, such as condition and size, before paying the seller.
